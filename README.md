# Coins and Boxes
Coins and Boxes is a game that was made during CSE 271: Object-Oriented Programming. This game was made in Java using various libraries, like JFrame and Java Swing, to create a pretty simple arcade-style game. Coins and boxes are falling from the ceiling, and the player must dodge the boxes to collect coins. However, the player falls as well, and must constantly jump to avoid an instant game over. The game is over once the player crashes into five boxes, or falls into the void below.
